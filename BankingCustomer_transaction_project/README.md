# 🏦 Banking Customer & Transaction Analytics Project

End-to-End Analytics & Modelling Pipeline

This project replicates a real-world banking analytics workflow: starting from a public transaction dataset, cleaning and structuring it in SQL, validating and modelling customer behaviour in Python, and finally delivering business-ready dashboards in Tableau.

It demonstrates my ability to design analytical pipelines, build KPIs, perform predictive modelling, and translate data into actionable business insights.

🧭 Workflow Overview

1. Data Preparation & Cleaning (SQL)

- Performed extensive data quality checks on customers, branches, and transactions.
- Identified and documented data inconsistencies (e.g. implausible balances and investments).
- Built clean analytical views and feature-ready tables for downstream analysis.

Key outputs:
- Clean customer, transaction, and branch views
- Documented financial assumptions and constraints

---

2. Analytical Exploration (SQL)

- Customer segmentation by type, age, and region
- Transaction behaviour analysis (volume, seasonality, account types)
- Investment trends and intensity metrics
- Branch-level performance and profitability indicators

These analyses support both dashboarding and modelling stages.

---

3. Modelling & Validation (Python)

- Built a classification model to estimate the probability that a customer is a high investor
- Built a regression model to estimate expected investment amounts
- Evaluated model performance and feature importance
- Prepared prediction-ready datasets for dashboard integration

---

4. Visual Analytics (Tableau)

Three dashboards were created:

- Customers & Investment Overview  
- Operational & Branch Performance  
- Predictive Insights (model-based estimates)

Dashboard screenshots are available in the `tableau/` folder.
